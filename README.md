# Abstract
The Synthetic Longitudinal Business Database Beta Data Product (SynLBD) is an experimental data product produced by the U.S. Census Bureau in collaboration with Duke University, Cornell University, the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The purpose of the SynLBD is to provide users with access to a longitudinal business data product that can be used outside of a secure Census Bureau facility, without disclosing confidential information. The Census Bureau created version 2 of the SynLBD by synthesizing information from the (confidential) LBD  on establishments‘ employment and payroll, establishments‘ birth and death years, and industrial classification. The Census Bureau's Disclosure Review Board and their counterparts at IRS have reviewed the content of the file, and allowed the release of these data for public use.
